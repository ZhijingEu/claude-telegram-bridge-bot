# Claude Telegram Bridge Bot

A digital family assistant designed to work with Claude Haiku + Google Calendar & Google Tasks. Family members can use Telegram Chat to naturally talk to the bot and coordinate events on your family calendar, manage family tasks, web search and even do basic image analysis/OCR extraction.

Built and described in: *[I Built This Before Anthropic Did — and That Taught Me When to Build at All](https://zhijingeu.medium.com/i-built-this-before-anthropic-did-heres-what-that-taught-me-about-when-to-build-at-all-ee12f01954ff)* (Medium, 2026)

## What it does

- **Natural language calendar queries** — "what's on this week?", "when is the next dentist appointment?"
- **Calendar writes** — create, update, and delete events with a confirmation step before anything executes
- **Task management** — create and complete Google Tasks
- **Image Search** — leverages Claude Haiku's native image interpretation capabilities that supports various image formats, including JPEG, PNG, GIF, and WebP
- **Multi-user** — primary user gets full access (all calendars + tasks); authorized family members get read-only access to the shared family calendar
- **Web search** — location queries, travel times, and recommendations via Claude's web search tool
- **Security** — input injection detection, output anomaly filter, kill switch, and Telegram ID whitelist

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- A Google Cloud project with the Calendar API and Tasks API enabled
- A Google OAuth 2.0 client (Desktop app type) — download `credentials.json`
- A Telegram bot token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
- An Anthropic API key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)

---

## Setup

### 1. Clone and create a virtual environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Claude-telegram-bot.git
cd Claude-telegram-bot
python -m venv venv

# Windows (Git Bash)
source venv/Scripts/activate

# macOS / Linux
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Google OAuth credentials

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com) → APIs & Services → Credentials
2. Create an OAuth 2.0 Client ID (Desktop app)
3. Download and save as `credentials.json` in the project root

Enable these APIs in your project:
- Google Calendar API
- Google Tasks API

> **Note:** If your OAuth app is in Testing mode, tokens expire every 7 days. Publish the app to Production to remove this limit.

### 3. Configure secrets

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and fill in:
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` — from @BotFather
- `PRIMARY_USER_TELEGRAM_ID` — your Telegram user ID (message [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) to find it)
- `PARTNER_TELEGRAM_ID` — optional partner/secondary user ID
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — from console.anthropic.com

### 4. Configure personal settings

```bash
cp telegram_bot/config.yaml.example telegram_bot/config.yaml
```

Edit `telegram_bot/config.yaml` and fill in:
- Your timezone (IANA format, e.g. `Asia/Singapore`, `Europe/London`)
- Your Google Calendar IDs (find these in Google Calendar → Settings → click a calendar)
- Display names and calendar prefixes for each family member
- The env var names for each user's Telegram ID (must match what you put in `.env`)

### 5. First-time authentication

On first run, a browser window will open for Google OAuth consent. After completing the flow, `token.json` and `token_tasks.json` are saved automatically — subsequent runs are silent.

```bash
source venv/Scripts/activate
python src/auth.py  # or just start the bot — it will trigger auth if needed
```

### 6. Start the bot

**Windows (Git Bash):**
```bash
bash telegram_bot/bot_runner.sh
```

**Manually:**
```bash
source venv/Scripts/activate
cd telegram_bot
python telegram_bot.py
```

The bot runs on your local machine. It must be running for Telegram messages to be received.

## Architecture notes

- **Model:** Claude Haiku (`claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`) for all natural language queries — fast and cheap (~$0.008/message with tool calling)
- **Routing:** Stages 1–8a are hardcoded (auth, security checks, task routing); stage 8b+ uses a Haiku tool-calling loop for calendar queries and writes
- **Calendar tools:** `query_calendar`, `query_tasks`, `create_event`, `update_event`, `delete_event` (max 8 tool-call rounds per message)
- **Write confirmation:** Haiku proposes a write → user confirms with "yes" → `write_calendar.py --confirm` executes
- **Conversation memory:** 6-turn rolling window per user, in-memory (resets on bot restart)
- **Security:** Input injection pattern check, output anomaly filter, weighted kill switch, Telegram ID whitelist

---

## Cost

At typical personal usage (a few queries per day):
- ~$0.002 per simple query (single Haiku call)
- ~$0.008 per query using the tool-calling loop (3–4 rounds)
- Estimated $0.50–$2/month total

---

## Security notes

- All calendar and task data is tagged as untrusted external input — event descriptions are never treated as instructions
- Telegram ID whitelist — unknown users are silently ignored; the primary user receives an alert after 3 messages from an unknown ID
- Kill switch — weighted security event counter; if threshold is reached within 5 minutes, the primary user is alerted and the bot shuts down
- OAuth tokens are stored unencrypted at rest — keep your machine's filesystem access controlled
